```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
library(rethinking)
```

m6.6 is the model with just an intercept, m6.7 is the model that includes both treatment and fungus (the post-treatment variable), and m6.8 is the model that includes treatment but omits fungus. Itâ€™s m6.8 that allows us to correctly infer the causal influence of treatment.

## Model selection

```{r calculate WAIC}
set.seed(11)
WAIC( m6.7)
```

```{r compare WAIC}
set.seed(77)
compare( m6.6,m6.7,m6.8,func=WAIC)
```

```{r dSE by hand}
set.seed(91)
waic_m6.7 <-WAIC(m6.7,pointwise=TRUE)$WAIC
waic_m6.8 <-WAIC(m6.8,pointwise=TRUE)$WAIC
n <-length(waic_m6.7)
diff_m6.7_m6.8 <-waic_m6.7-waic_m6.8
sqrt( n*var(diff_m6.7_m6.8))
```

```{r 99% interval of difference}
40.9 +c(-1,1)*10.4*2.6
```

```{r plot comparison}
plot( compare(m6.6,m6.7,m6.8))
```

```{r compare m6.6, m6.8}
set.seed(92)
waic_m6.6 <-WAIC(m6.6,pointwise=TRUE)$WAIC
diff_m6.6_m6.8 <-waic_m6.6-waic_m6.8
sqrt( n*var(diff_m6.6_m6.8))
```

```{r automatically calculate}
set.seed(93)
compare( m6.6,m6.7,m6.8)@dSE
```
