## Symmetry

```{r compute the difference between a nation in Africa and outside Africa, holding its ruggedness constant}
rugged_seq <- seq(from = -0.2, to = 1.2, length.out = 30)
muA <- link(m8.3, data = data.frame(cid = 1, rugged_std = rugged_seq))
muN <- link(m8.3, data = data.frame(cid = 2, rugged_std = rugged_seq))
delta <- muA - muN
```
